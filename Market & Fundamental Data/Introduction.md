Data has always been an essential driver of trading, and traders have long made efforts to gain an advantage from access to superior information.

Today, modern traders, especially **high frequency trading (HFT)** firms, invest in ultra-fast data connections. However, because ultra-fast access can give an unfair advantage, regulators now use **speed-bumps** - intentional delays in processing orders to level the playing field. This is meant to prevent abuse from firms who might otherwise exploit tiny time advantages for arbitrage.
